# The Mighty Calculator

okay, maybe not mighty, but a nice simple one

This is the final project for The Odin Project's Foundations course. Though my code doesn't look significant, the time spent looking up information was. This project represents roughly 8hrs because I couldn't for the life of me, figure out why the first click was creating a double digit in the display but not in the console. Well, problem solved! and I hope you like it. 

**What I learned**

- How to use the eval function in JavaScript
- Continue using functions, querySelectors and eventListeners
- More practice with Bootstrap

You can view the project here

**Thanks for looking**
